# User Stories – Cleaner App Australia

User stories describe the key actions users need to perform in the application, written from their point of view.  
They follow the standard format:  
**“As a [user], I want [action], so that [benefit].”**

These stories help define the MVP and ensure the app focuses on real users and real needs.

## 🧹 Cleaner User Stories

1. **As a cleaner, I want to create a new job, so that I can organize my work for the day.**

2. **As a cleaner, I want to view a checklist for each area (kitchen, bathroom, living room, etc.), so that I don’t forget any cleaning tasks.**

3. **As a cleaner, I want to mark checklist items as completed, so that I can keep track of my progress.**

4. **As a cleaner, I want to take photos of the job (before/after or final result), so that I have proof of work in case the client questions the cleaning.**

5. **As a cleaner, I want to record the time spent on each job, so that I can calculate payment and improve my scheduling.**

6. **As a cleaner, I want to see all the jobs assigned to me for the day, so that I know my schedule clearly.**
